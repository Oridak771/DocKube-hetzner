# Contributing to the Documentation

We welcome contributions to improve the Kube-Hetzner documentation! This guide will help you get started with contributing to the docs.

## Documentation Structure

The documentation is built using Docusaurus and is located in the `docs/` directory. The main documentation files are in Markdown format with frontmatter for metadata.

## Auto-Generated Documentation

**Important Note for Contributors**: The main variables reference page (`docs/configuration/terraform.md`) is automatically generated from the Terraform module's code comments using `terraform-docs`. Do not edit this file manually, as your changes will be overwritten during the next documentation build.

If you need to update variable descriptions or add new variables:
1. Update the comments in the Terraform module's `variables.tf` file
2. Run `terraform-docs` to regenerate the documentation
3. Commit both the source code changes and the regenerated documentation

## Making Changes

### For New Documentation

1. Create a new Markdown file in the appropriate directory under `docs/`
2. Add the required frontmatter:
   ```yaml
   ---
   sidebar_position: X
   ---
   ```
3. Write your content using Markdown
4. Update `sidebars.ts` to include the new page in the navigation

### For Existing Documentation

1. Locate the relevant Markdown file in `docs/`
2. Make your changes
3. Ensure the content follows the established style and structure

## Style Guidelines

- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples where appropriate
- Use proper heading hierarchy (H1 for title, H2 for sections, etc.)
- Include cross-references to related documentation
- Test all code examples for accuracy

## Testing Your Changes

To preview your documentation changes locally:

1. Navigate to the `docu/` directory
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm start`
4. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

## Submitting Changes

1. Create a pull request with your changes
2. Ensure all new pages are properly linked in the sidebar
3. Verify that the documentation builds successfully
4. Request review from maintainers

## Areas for Contribution

- **New Features**: Document newly added features and configuration options
- **Examples**: Add practical examples and use cases
- **Troubleshooting**: Expand troubleshooting guides
- **Best Practices**: Share best practices and recommendations
- **Tutorials**: Create step-by-step guides for common tasks
